# BevoBeats

Our submission to Freetail Hackers RecordHacks 2025. BevoBeats is an audio visualization app to help visually impaired people enjoy music.

# How it works
As an audio plays, our app analyzes the patterns in the audio waves to dynamically generate a visualization that changes based on various qualities of the song, such as rhythm, tempo, mood, volume, etc.
